      Method:
    </span>
    <dl>
      **Chole (Chickpea Curry)**
      <dt>Step 1 - Soak Chickpeas</dt>
      <dd>
        Rinse the chickpeas thoroughly and soak them in enough water overnight or for at least 8 hours.
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Step 2 - Pressure Cook Chickpeas</dt>
      <dd>
        Drain the soaked chickpeas and add them to a pressure cooker with the bay leaf, cardamom pod, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Cover with water and pressure cook for 4-5 whistles or until the chickpeas are tender.
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Step 3 - Make the Chole Masala</dt>
      <dd>
        Heat oil in a pan or cooker over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and coriander seeds. Once they splutter, add the chopped onions and cook until softened and translucent.
        <br>
        Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute until fragrant. Stir in turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala powder. Cook for another minute until the spices become fragrant.
        <br>
        Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become mushy and release their juices. Mash the tomatoes with a spoon if needed.
        <br>
        Add the cooked chickpeas along with the water used for pressure cooking (adjust the amount for desired consistency). Season with salt to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the flavors have melded.
        <br>
        Garnish with chopped coriander leaves before serving.
      </dd>
      <br>

      **Bhature (Fried Bread)**
      <dt>Step 1 - Make the Dough</dt>
      <dd>
        In a large bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina, yogurt, sugar, salt, and baking soda. Mix well using a spoon or your hands. Gradually add water to knead into a soft and slightly sticky dough.
        <br>
        Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Step 2 - Shape and Fry the Bhature</dt>
      <dd>
        Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai over medium heat. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into small circles. 
        <br>
        Make a small well in the center of each circle with your thumb. Gently stretch the dough to create a slightly puffy center.
        <br>
        Pick up the dough circle and gently stretch it again to form an oval shape. This will create a light and fluffy bhatura.
        <br>
        Once the oil is hot enough (around 350Â°F), carefully slide the bhatura into the hot oil. Fry on medium heat until golden brown from both sides.
        <br>
        Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Step 3 - Serve</dt>
      <dd>
        Serve hot chole with bhature. Enjoy!

I've added the remaining steps for making Chole Masala and Bhature. This includes instructions for simmering the Chole with spices and tomatoes, garnishing with coriander, making the Bhature dough with yogurt and letting it rest, shaping the dough with a well in the center, and frying the Bhatura until golden brown.
